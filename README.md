# Simple Fighting Game

Welcome to the Simple Fighting Game! This is a basic fighting game built using the HTML canvas element and JavaScript. It features different backgrounds and player movements, using PNG images obtained from the itch.io platform. The game also utilizes the "Press Start" font from Google Fonts and a color palette inspired by the "Kuler Color Theme" website. Animation effects on the health bar are achieved using the GSAP CDN (GreenSock Animation Platform).
